# Description
-----------------------
## This project focuses on an in-depth analysis of an anime dataset. We conducted a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights about various features of anime, including scores, popularity, genres, and more. The analysis involves data cleaning, univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, as well as visualizations to effectively present the findings.

# Features
--------------------------

   ### 1-Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, converting data types, and ensuring data consistency.
    
   ### 2-Univariate Analysis: Analyzing individual features through histograms, box plots, and bar charts.
    
   ### 3-Bivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between pairs of variables using scatter plots and correlation analysis.
    
   ### 4-Multivariate Analysis: Investigating complex relationships among multiple features.
    
   ### 5-Temporal Analysis: Analyzing trends over time for features such as 'Aired' and 'Premiered'.
    
   ### 6-Genre and Studio Analysis: Exploring the distribution of anime across different genres and studios.
    
   ### 7-Episode Duration Analysis: Investigating the distribution of episode durations and their relationship with scores and popularity.
    
   ### 8-Visualization: Using various color palettes and visualization techniques to enhance readability and aesthetics.
